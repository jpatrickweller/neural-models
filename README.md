# Neural Models

This repository contains code I wrote during graduate school to model the responses of V1 neurons. 

PD_Estimate_Variance.m: This script models the responses of LN neurons tuned to various directions in the LM plane. By fitting the modeled responses, we can estimate bias and confidence intervals in the estimated preferred directions.
